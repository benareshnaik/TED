        Cabinet Approves ₹3,175 Crore Highway Upgrade in Telangana
        </h3>

        <p>
        The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved a ₹3,175 crore project to upgrade 80 km of National Highway 167 in Telangana into a four-lane access-controlled highway. The stretch from Gudebellur to Mahabubnagar forms a key segment of the Hyderabad–Panaji corridor and is expected to significantly improve connectivity and regional mobility.</p>
        
        <p>The project will enhance road geometry, reduce congestion in urban areas, and incorporate modern safety features to support vehicle speeds of up to 100 km/h. By streamlining traffic flow and limiting access points, the upgraded highway aims to reduce travel time and improve commuter safety. Importantly, it will strengthen connectivity between industrial hubs such as Raichur and Hyderabad, facilitating smoother freight movement across state borders.</p>
        
        <p>Officials estimate the construction phase will generate over 32 lakh person-days of employment, providing a boost to the local economy. The improved corridor is also expected to link key economic nodes, pharmaceutical clusters, and logistics hubs, lowering transportation costs and enhancing supply chain efficiency. Ministers have welcomed the decision, calling it a major step toward accelerating infrastructure development and supporting long-term regional growth in southern India.</p>

        National Environment Youth Parliament Begins in Nagpur
        </h3>

        <p>
        The National Environment Youth Parliament commenced in Nagpur, bringing together 200 student finalists from across the country to deliberate on pressing environmental challenges. The event serves as a dynamic platform for young minds to engage in structured debates and policy discussions focused on sustainable solutions for water conservation, forest protection, and biodiversity preservation.</p>
        
        <p>Participants, selected through rigorous regional and state-level competitions, are simulating parliamentary proceedings by presenting resolutions, raising questions, and proposing actionable strategies. Discussions on water sustainability highlighted rainwater harvesting, watershed management, groundwater recharge, and efficient irrigation practices to combat water scarcity. On forest conservation, students emphasized afforestation drives, protection of tribal ecosystems, and stronger enforcement against illegal logging</p>
        
        <p>Biodiversity protection formed another core theme, with delegates advocating habitat restoration, wildlife corridor development, and reduction of plastic pollution. Experts and mentors guided sessions, encouraging evidence-based policymaking and youth-led innovation. The Parliament not only promotes environmental awareness but also nurtures leadership, collaboration, and democratic participation among students. Organizers believe the recommendations emerging from the forum could inspire real-world action and contribute to India’s long-term sustainability goals.

        <p>
        India's Union Cabinet greenlit projects worth ₹1.6 lakh crore on February 14, 2026, to boost connectivity and growth, highlighted by a 34-km Gohpur-Numaligarh corridor in Assam featuring a 15.79-km twin-tube road-cum-rail tunnel costing ₹18,662 crore. This slashes travel time from six hours to 20 minutes, creates 80 lakh human-days of jobs, and strengthens security and trade. Other approvals include 389 km of rail multi-tracking in Delhi-Ambala, Kasara-Manmad, and Ballari-Hosapete; a Noida Metro extension; a ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund; and a ₹10,000 crore startup fund, all aimed at jobs, logistics savings, and sustainable development.

        Upcoming Solar Eclipse: India prepares for the first solar eclipse of 2026 on Feb 17, featuring a ‘ring of fire’ appearance, sparking interest among skywatchers and astrologers nationwide
        </h3>

        <p>
        India is gearing up for the first solar eclipse of 2026, set to occur on February 17, an event that is already generating widespread excitement among astronomers, skywatchers, and astrologers. The eclipse is expected to display a spectacular “ring of fire” effect—an annular solar eclipse—where the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun but does not completely cover it. As a result, a bright ring of sunlight remains visible around the dark silhouette of the Moon.</p>
        
        <p>Scientific institutions, including the Indian Space Research Organisation, have encouraged citizens to observe the phenomenon safely using certified solar viewing glasses or indirect viewing methods. Planetariums and science centers across major cities are preparing special observation sessions and awareness programs to educate the public about the science behind eclipses.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond its scientific significance, the eclipse has also sparked discussions in cultural and astrological circles, with many people following traditional practices associated with such celestial events. Experts, however, stress the importance of relying on scientific guidance for safe viewing. The rare celestial display is expected to draw large crowds, making it one of the most anticipated astronomical events of the year in India.

        Just a Story
        </h3>
          
        <p>
        The year was 2026, and Arjun found himself at the center of a historic <b>trilateral</b> summit between India, Japan, and Indonesia. As a young delegate, his task was to <b>deliberate</b> on a massive cross-border initiative: a plan for aggressive <b>afforestation</b> to restore the lost corridors of Southeast Asia.</p>
        
        <p>To reach the summit’s eco-hub in Telangana, Arjun traveled via a sleek, <b>access-controlled</b> highway. The road was a marvel of engineering, cutting through the landscape with surgical precision, allowing his electric transport to glide at 100 km/h without the interruption of local traffic.</p>
        
        <p>On the final evening, the sky offered a celestial omen. An <b>annular</b> solar eclipse began to unfold. As the Moon moved into position, it failed to cover the Sun completely, leaving a brilliant "ring of fire" hanging over the horizon. Under this golden halo, the delegates finally signed their agreement. Arjun looked up, realizing that just as the moon and sun aligned to create a rare ring, their three nations had aligned to protect the earth. The high-speed journey and the high-stakes debate had led to a single, luminous moment of unity.
